/**
 * `nuxt-native init` never runs `ns create` — it calls `ns platform add
 * android` directly against a project with no App_Resources at all (see
 * `init.mjs`). Reading the real CLI's source
 * (`android-project-service.js`'s `ensureConfigurationFileInAppResources`)
 * confirms it only *warns* "No manifest found" and moves on when a
 * project supplies none — it never synthesizes one from
 * `@nativescript/template-hello-world-ts` or any other up-to-date
 * template, only `ns create` does that. So a from-scratch `platform add`
 * falls back to whatever AndroidManifest.xml `@nativescript/android`'s own
 * runtime bundles internally, and that can be out of sync with the
 * modern adaptive-icon convention (`android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"`,
 * confirmed current in both hello-world-ts@9.1.1 and 8.1.1) — reproduced
 * by a real user's Gradle failure: "resource drawable/icon ... not
 * found", meaning their resolved fallback manifest still points at the
 * older `@drawable/icon` convention, and nothing at that path exists.
 *
 * Fix is deliberately additive, not a manifest edit: this project already
 * avoids hand-touching NativeScript's own generated AndroidManifest.xml
 * (see ARCHITECTURE.md's `init` row) — instead this just makes sure
 * a `drawable` density variant of `icon.png` exists too, alongside
 * whatever `mipmap` density variant of `ic_launcher.png` the runtime
 * already produced, so the app resolves correctly under either manifest
 * convention. An unreferenced drawable is inert, so this is safe to run
 * unconditionally on every init.
