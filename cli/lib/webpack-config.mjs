/**
 * Writes webpack.config.cjs if the project doesn't have one yet — the
 * NativeScript CLI (`ns build`/`ns run`) requires this file (pointed at via
 * `bundlerConfigPath` in nativescript.config.ts, see ensureNativeScriptConfig)
 * plus a `@nativescript/webpack` devDependency.
 *
 * It's `.cjs`, not `.js`: `@nativescript/webpack` loads this file with a
 * plain `require(configPath)` (confirmed by reading its bin source), and
 * nuxt-native-generated projects have `"type": "module"` in package.json —
 * under that, a plain `.js` file is loaded as an ES module and `require()`
 * throws ERR_REQUIRE_ESM. `.cjs` is always CommonJS regardless of the
 * package's `"type"`, which is exactly what this file's `require()`/
 * `module.exports` syntax needs. Verified by invoking the generated config
 * directly with `node -e "require('./webpack.config.js')(...)"` — reproduced
 * ERR_REQUIRE_ESM with the `.js` name, confirmed clean with `.cjs`.
 *
 * `@nativescript/webpack` ships a base "vue" module rule and a
 * VueLoaderPlugin placeholder, but does not wire up an actual vue-loader —
 * nativescript-vue ships that wiring itself as
 * `nativescript-vue/nativescript.webpack.js` (it also aliases the bare
 * "vue" specifier to "nativescript-vue" at the bundler level, which is what
 * lets composables written as `import { ref } from 'vue'` resolve
 * correctly in the on-device bundle). Without this file, `.vue` pages have
 * no loader at all and webpack fails immediately on the first import.
 *
 * The `#build/nuxt-native/route-manifest.mjs` alias: useNativeRouter.ts
 * (nuxt-native's own composable) imports its route table from that exact
 * specifier — `#build` is a Nuxt-internal alias Nuxt's OWN Vite/webpack
 * build registers, resolving to `.nuxt/`. The native build never goes
 * through Nuxt's builder at all, so that alias doesn't exist here —
 * reproduced directly: `Module not found: Can't resolve
 * '#build/nuxt-native/route-manifest.mjs'`. Aliasing the same literal
 * specifier to this project's own CLI-generated `.nuxt-native/
 * route-manifest.mjs` lets the identical composable source resolve
 * correctly in both contexts without forking it.
 *
 * `appId` gets embedded directly into the generated file (not read at
 * build time from `nativescript.config.ts`, to avoid this CJS config
 * file needing to parse a `.ts` file itself): it's passed to
 * `NuxtNativeAppIdentifierPlugin` (see app-identifier-webpack-plugin.cjs),
 * which writes `<output>/package.json` with the project's real app id
 * and whatever entry chunk filename webpack actually emitted —
 * NativeScript's native runtime bootstrap reads that exact file at
 * launch to find the app's entry point and its real package name (a
 * real crash — "Application entry point file not found" — confirmed
 * this file's absence is fatal, not just a Gradle-time concern).

  // in-build type-error reporting a project already gets another way (its

  // small machine this is pure, avoidable memory pressure with no
  // compile-time benefit, not a real tradeoff. \`order: 10\`: this plugin is
  // registered by a callback @nativescript/webpack's own \`webpack.init(env)\`
