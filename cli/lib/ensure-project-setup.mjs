/**
 * Every idempotent native-project patch this framework needs, run on
 * every init/dev/build — not just init. Previously these only ran inside
 * `init()`, which meant a project only stayed correctly configured if
 * someone remembered to rerun `nuxt-native init` after adding a
 * dependency (ours or a third-party plugin's) later in the project's
 * life. Every function called here is already safe to call on every
 * single invocation (marker-comment-gated, or a plain existence check —
 * confirmed via real, repeated reruns earlier in this framework's
 * development), so there's no cost to running them unconditionally
 * instead of only once.
