/**
 * Runs native setup for every third-party plugin a project lists in
 * `nuxt.config.ts`'s `native.plugins` array. A "nuxt-native plugin" is
 * just an ordinary npm package — nothing here requires our permission or
 * access to this repo. The one convention it can optionally follow: if it
 * needs a native Gradle dependency, an Android permission, an iOS
 * Info.plist entry, etc., it exports a `"./nuxt-native"` subpath (its
 * package.json `exports` map needs to declare this — a bare
 * `require.resolve("<name>/nuxt-native")` from a consuming project is
 * blocked otherwise, the same exports-map restriction confirmed on this
 * package itself earlier) whose module exports an
 * `ensure(projectRoot, platforms)` function. That function gets called on
 * every init/dev/build, the same as this framework's own
 * `ensureWebSocketDependency`/`ensureNetworkSecurityConfig` — so plugin
 * authors should make it idempotent the same way (a marker-comment guard
 * via `ensureMarkedBlock`, or a plain existence check), since it can run
 * many times over a project's life, not just once.
 *
 * A plugin with no `"./nuxt-native"` export at all is left alone — most
 * plugins (anything that's pure JS/TS interop against an already-present
 * native API, or that wraps another already-installed NativeScript
 * plugin needing no extra native config) don't need this step.
