/**
 * Generates an Android release-signing keystore via `keytool` (ships with
 * any JDK — not reimplemented here). Never persists the password anywhere:
 * that's a real secret, and a local config file is exactly the kind of
 * thing that ends up committed by accident. Instead this prints the
 * NUXT_NATIVE_KEYSTORE_* environment variable names `build.mjs` already
 * knows to read, so the workflow is "set them once in your shell profile
 * or CI secrets, then just run `nuxt-native build android --release`" —
 * no flags to retype, nothing sensitive on disk.

IMPORTANT: back this file up somewhere safe, outside version control —
losing it means you can never publish an update to an app already signed
with it.

Build a signed release either by passing the flags directly:
  nuxt-native build android --release \\
    --key-store-path ${outputPath} --key-store-password <password> \\
    --key-store-alias ${alias} --key-store-alias-password <password>

...or set these once (shell profile, CI secrets) and just run
\`nuxt-native build android --release\` — it reads them automatically:
  NUXT_NATIVE_KEYSTORE_PATH=${outputPath}
  NUXT_NATIVE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<password>
  NUXT_NATIVE_KEYSTORE_ALIAS=${alias}
  NUXT_NATIVE_KEYSTORE_ALIAS_PASSWORD=<password>
