/**
 * NativeScript has no global `WebSocket` (confirmed directly on a real
 * device this session — `typeof WebSocket` is `"undefined"`), and
 * @nativescript/core's own HTTP module uses its own native widget
 * (org.nativescript.widgets.Async.Http.MakeRequest, confirmed by reading
 * its Android implementation directly), not OkHttp — so OkHttp isn't on
 * the classpath just from depending on core. `nuxt-native init` adds it
 * as a real Gradle dependency (see cli/lib/websocket-setup.mjs), and this
 * talks to its real, stable WebSocket API directly via NativeScript's
 * Java interop — `SomeJavaClass.extend({...})` to subclass an abstract
 * Java class from JS, confirmed as the real, standard NativeScript
 * pattern by reading three independent real usages in @nativescript/
 * core's own source (ui/frame/activity.android.js, fragment.android.js,
 * index.android.js) before writing this.
 *
 * Import this WITHOUT a `.js` suffix — `import { useWebSocket } from
 * 'nuxt-native/runtime/composables/useWebSocket'`, unlike every other
 * composable in this framework (which use an explicit `.js` suffix).
 * This is the first platform-split composable (`.android.ts`/`.ios.ts`,
 * the same convention @nativescript/core itself uses), and confirmed
 * directly via a real webpack compile that the two resolution mechanisms
 * involved don't compose the way you'd expect: `nuxt-native`'s package.json
 * `"./runtime/*"` export is a wildcard needing an exact target file, so an
 * explicit `.js` suffix gets resolved *before* webpack's own platform-
 * extension list (`.android.js`/`.ios.js`/`.js`, confirmed in
 * @nativescript/webpack's own config) ever gets a chance to run — it
 * fails with "no valid target file was found" since no bare
 * `useWebSocket.js` exists, only the two platform variants. Dropping the
 * suffix lets webpack apply its own extension resolution to the
 * wildcard-substituted path instead, which correctly picks the right
 * platform file — reproduced both ways with a real compile before
 * settling on this.
