 * Thin wrapper over nativescript-vue's own $showModal/$closeModal — not

 * nuxt-native (useNativeRouter, useDevice, ...) instead of the framework's
 * plain exported-function shape.
 *
 * ShowModalOptions isn't re-exported from nativescript-vue's package root
 * (only reachable via its internal dist/plugins/modals path — same
 * situation useNativeRouter.ts hit with NavigateBackOptions), so its shape
 * is derived from $showModal's own signature instead of importing a path
 * that isn't part of its public API.
