Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) first — it lists exactly what's
implemented, what's untested, and what's genuinely missing. That status
table is the most current source of truth for where help is needed; if it's
out of date after you land a change, update it in the same PR.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:prepare   # builds the module in stub mode + prepares the playground
npm run dev           # runs the playground through Nuxt (module DX / typecheck only —
                       # see ARCHITECTURE.md on why this doesn't render native UI)
```

### Windows: "Cannot find native binding" (rolldown)

If `npm run dev:prepare`/`npm run dev` fails with `Cannot find native binding`
pointing at `rolldown`, it's a known npm optional-dependency resolution bug
([npm/cli#4828](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828)) that sometimes
drops the platform-specific binding on Windows. Fix it locally with:

```bash
npm install @rolldown/binding-win32-x64-msvc --no-save
```

Don't commit that dependency — it's a machine-specific workaround, not a
project dependency (`--no-save` keeps it out of package.json).

Testing an actual native build currently requires the NativeScript CLI
toolchain (Xcode for iOS, Android Studio/SDK for Android) set up locally —
see the [NativeScript environment setup docs](https://docs.nativescript.org/environment-setup).
This has not been exercised end-to-end yet; if you get further than
ARCHITECTURE.md's status table implies, that's valuable signal — please
open an issue with what broke.
